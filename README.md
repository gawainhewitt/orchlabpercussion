# orchlabpercussion


The first of a suite of instruments developed by [Gawain Hewitt](http://www.gawainhewitt.co.uk) for [Drake Music](http://www.drakemusic.org) to explore the feasibility of making accessible online musical instruments for use in workshops during the pandemic of 2020/21.


A simple sample based percussion sampler built using p5.js.


Use the keys qwertyui or mouse click or touch to play.

I found that the current p5.sound library sounds awful on android so have used an old version to hack around this for now.
